Malicious URL Detection System Using Machine Learning, Deep Learning and NLP

Project Description:

The Malicious URL Detection System is a comprehensive and powerful platform for detecting and preventing access to malicious websites using machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. 

The system's primary goal is to identify and categorize URLs into safe or malicious, thereby safeguarding users from cyber threats and enhancing overall internet security.

The project's frontend is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while the backend is built using the Flask web framework.

The entire model pipeline, from data ingestion and preprocessing to model building, is implemented in Python, with extensive logging and custom exception handling to ensure optimal performance and maintainability.
